### App Name Here <br />
## Description <br />
Our app will be a social networking application for discussing books and TV shows of the userâ€™s interest. Each user will have their own profile displaying their username, the number of episodes watched in their TV shows, and the number of chapters read in their books. There will be a discussion board for each chapter or episode where users can post comments and reply to each other. We will be using a made up database of ten books and ten TV shows for demonstration. <br />
