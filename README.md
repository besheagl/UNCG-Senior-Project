### Description <br />
Armchair will be a mobile web application for discussing books and TV shows of the userâ€™s interest. Each user will have their own profile displaying their profile picture and username, a list of shows watched, a list of shows currently being watched, and a list of their favorite shows. They will have the same features available for books. There will be a discussion board for each chapter or episode where users can post comments and reply to each other. We will be using a made up database of sample books and ten TV shows for demonstration. <br />
